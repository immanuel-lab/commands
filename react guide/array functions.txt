
Certainly! Here's a list of some commonly used array methods in JavaScript:

Iteration Methods:

forEach(callback(element, index, array)): Executes a provided function once for each array element.
map(callback(element, index, array)): Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.
filter(callback(element, index, array)): Creates a new array with elements that satisfy the provided function's condition.
find(callback(element, index, array)): Returns the first element that satisfies the provided function's condition.
findIndex(callback(element, index, array)): Returns the index of the first element that satisfies the provided function's condition.
some(callback(element, index, array)): Returns true if at least one element satisfies the provided function's condition.
every(callback(element, index, array)): Returns true if all elements satisfy the provided function's condition.
Modification Methods:

push(element): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length.
pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
unshift(element): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length.
splice(start, deleteCount, ...items): Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.
slice(start, end): Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array.
reverse(): Reverses the elements of an array in place.
sort(compareFunction): Sorts the elements of an array in place.
Searching and Checking Methods:

indexOf(element, fromIndex): Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
lastIndexOf(element, fromIndex): Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.
includes(element, fromIndex): Determines whether an array includes a certain element.
Transformation Methods:

concat(...arrays): Returns a new array comprised of this array joined with other arrays and/or values.
join(separator): Joins all elements of an array into a string, separated by the specified separator.
toString(): Returns a string representing the array.
toLocaleString(): Returns a localized string representing the array.
Utility Methods:

isArray(value): Returns true if the provided value is an array.
fill(value, start, end): Fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value.
These are just some of the many array methods available in JavaScript. Each method serves a specific purpose, making array manipulation and iteration more convenient.
